    <main>
        <p>Accommodations you can do in Maui Hawaii are:</p>
<h2>1. Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea</h2>
<p>4.7 •Hotel</p>
<p><img src="/images/hotel1.jpg" alt="This a hotel in maui hawaii"></p>
<p>Where: 3900 Wailea Alanui Dr, Kihei, HI 96753.</p>
<p>Why stay here: It’s one of the top-luxury resorts in Maui, and part of the well-known Four Seasons chain.</p>
<p>Vibe: Upscale, resort-style, great for couples, honeymooners, or anyone who wants premium service and facilities.</p>
<p>Good to know: If you want something more budget-friendly, this may be at the higher end of cost.</p>
<h2>2. Grand Wailea, A Waldorf Astoria Resort</h2>
<p>4.5 •Hotel</p>
<p><img src="/images/Resort2.jpg" alt="This a hotel in maui hawaii"></p>
<p>Where: 3850 Wailea Alanui Dr, Wailea, HI 96753.</p>
<p>Why stay here: Massive tropical-resort feel, lush grounds, lots of amenities. The “largest private employer on the island” is said to be this resort.</p>
<p>Vibe: Big resort, lots of activity, good if you like a lively environment with many facilities and things to do.</p>
<p>Good to know: If you prefer quieter boutique stays, this might be more “resort large” than “intimate”.</p>
<h2>3. Montage Kapalua Bay</h2>
<p>4.7 •Resort hotel</p>
<p><img src="/images/hotel3.jpg" alt="This a hotel in maui hawaii"></p>
<p>Where: 1 Bay Dr, Lahaina, HI 96761.</p>
<p>Why stay here: Villa-style accommodations, which often means more space (good for families or groups) and an upscale feel.</p>
<p>Vibe: More residential luxury, quieter and perhaps more secluded than big mega-resorts.</p>
<p>Good to know: Villas typically cost more, especially if you want multiple bedrooms.</p>
<h2>4. Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort</h2>
<p>4.6 •Hotel</p>
<p><img src="/images/hotel4.jpg" alt="This a hotel in maui hawaii"></p>
<p>Where: 3550 Wailea Alanui Dr, Wailea, HI 96753.</p>
<p>Why stay here: A bit more modern / trendy design, stylish amenities, great for design-savvy travellers.</p>
<p>Vibe: Chic, contemporary, good mix of luxury plus design-forward aesthetic.</p>
<p>Good to know: If you’re after the ‘classic resort’ feel, this might be a bit more modern than that.</p>
<h2>5. Hotel Wailea</h2>
<p>4.8 •Hotel</p>
<p><img src="/images/hotel5.jpg" alt="This a hotel in maui hawaii"></p>
<p>Where: 555 Kaukahi St, Wailea, HI 96753.</p>

<p>Vibe: Quiet, boutique, ideal for couples, honeymooners, or anyone wanting a more peaceful stay.</p>
<p>Good to know: May have fewer on-site amenities than the mega-resorts (but that might be exactly what you want).</p>
